## ðŸš€ How to Run These Tests

Make sure you're inside the `ui-testing` folder.

### 1. Install Playwright (if not already):
```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
**### 2. Run Tests:**

npx playwright test
Or run a specific test:

npx playwright test wikipedia-ui.spec.js
npx playwright test cnn-ui.spec.js
ðŸ›  Notes
These tests use Playwright Test's native assertions (e.g. expect(locator).toBeVisible()).

If a test fails, check if the site has changed structure (e.g. new selectors, dynamic content).

Ensure you have internet access while running tests.
